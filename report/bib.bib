abstract = {There are many different proposed procedures for sample size planning for the Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test at given type-I and type-II error rates $\alpha$ and $\beta$, respectively. Most methods assume very specific models or types of data to simplify calculations (eg, ordered categorical or metric data, location shift alternatives, etc). We present a unified approach that covers metric data with and without ties, count data, ordered categorical data, and even dichotomous data. For that, we calculate the unknown theoretical quantities such as the variances under the null and relevant alternative hypothesis by considering the following “synthetic data” approach. We evaluate data whose empirical distribution functions match the theoretical distribution functions involved in the computations of the unknown theoretical quantities. Then, well-known relations for the ranks of the data are used for the calculations. In addition to computing the necessary sample size N for a fixed allocation proportion t = n 1 /N, where n 1 is the sample size in the first group and N = n 1 + n 2 is the total sample size, we provide an interval for the optimal allocation rate t, which minimizes the total sample size N. It turns out that, for certain distributions, a balanced design is optimal. We give a characterization of such distributions. Furthermore, we show that the optimal choice of t depends on the ratio of the two variances, which determine the variance of the Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney statistic under the alternative. This is different from an optimal sample size allocation in case of the normal distribution model.},

abstract = {G*Power (Erdfelder, Faul, {\&} Buchner, 1996) was designed as a general stand-alone power analysis program for statistical tests commonly used in social and behavioral research. G*Power 3 is a major extension of, and improvement over, the previous versions. It runs on widely used computer platforms (i.e., Windows XP, Windows Vista, and Mac OS X 10.4) and covers many different statistical tests of the t, F, and $\chi$2 test families. In addition, it includes power analyses for z tests and some exact tests. G*Power 3 provides improved effect size calculators and graphic options, supports both distribution-based and design-based input modes, and offers all types of power analyses in which users might be interested. Like its predecessors, G*Power 3 is free. Copyright 2007 Psychonomic Society, Inc.},

@article{Cundill2015,
abstract = {Background: Sample size calculations should correspond to the intended method of analysis. Nevertheless, for non-normal distributions, they are often done on the basis of normal approximations, even when the data are to be analysed using generalized linear models (GLMs). Methods: For the case of comparison of two means, we use GLM theory to derive sample size formulae, with particular cases being the negative binomial, Poisson, binomial, and gamma families. By simulation we estimate the performance of normal approximations, which, via the identity link, are special cases of our approach, and for common link functions such as the log. The negative binomial and gamma scenarios are motivated by examples in hookworm vaccine trials and insecticide-treated materials, respectively. Results: Calculations on the link function (log) scale work well for the negative binomial and gamma scenarios examined and are often superior to the normal approximations. However, they have little advantage for the Poisson and binomial distributions. Conclusions: The proposed method is suitable for sample size calculations for comparisons of means of highly skewed outcome variables.},

@article{Chakraborti2006,
abstract = {Sample size determination methods are considered for hypothesis testing about location parameters of two continuous distributions using independent random samples and the Mann-Whitney-Wilcoxon (MWW) test, for a specified shift, size, and power. These methods are based on the so-called "Noether's formula," derived from a normal approximation to the power of the MWW test, and a pilot sample from each of the distributions. Compared with alternate methods, including the one using bootstrap similar to that of Hamilton and Collings (1991) the new methods are shown to be at least as good in terms of accuracy and substantially more efficient in terms of speed and variability. The simpler method, using linearly smoothed empirical cdf's of the pilot samples and requiring no bootstrapping, is recommended for practical use. Extensions and adaptations for obtaining an upper confidence bound on the sample size and to general linear rank tests are indicated. {\textcopyright} 2006 American Statistical Association.},

@article{Hamilton1991,
abstract = {For the case in which two independent samples arc to be compared using a nonparametric test for location shift, we propose a bootstrap technique for estimating the sample sizes required to achieve a specified power. The estimator (called BOOT) uses information from a small pilot experiment. For the special case of the Wilcoxon test, a simulation study is conducted to compare BOOT to two other sample-size estimators. One method (called ANPV) is based on the assumption that the underlying distribution is normal with a variance estimated from the pilot data. The other method (called NOETHER) adapts the sample size formula of Noether for use with a location-shift alternative. The BOOT and NOETHER sample-size estimators are particularly appropriate for this nonparametric setting because they do not require assumptions about the shape of the underlying continuous probability distribution. The simulation study shows that (a) sample size estimates can have large uncertainty, (b) BOOT is at least as accurate as and can be much more accurate than ANPV, and (c) BOOT and NOETHER achieve similar accuracy, although NOETHER is prone to underestimation. {\textcopyright} 1991 American statistical association and the American society for quality control.},

@article{Rodriguez2009,
abstract = {To provide information for public health policy on mosquito nets in the Amazon region of Colombia, we conducted landing catches to estimate Anopheles species composition and biting activity. Two hundred twenty person-nights of catches were done in seven locations over a period of 14 mo. A total of 1,780 Anopheles mosquitoes were caught (8.1 per person-night). Among the nine species found, An. oswaldoi Peryass{\'{u}} was the most common (776 mosquitoes, 44{\%}), followed by An. darlingi Root s.l. (498, 28{\%}). An. oswaldoi was the most common species collected outdoors, where its biting rate dropped steadily from a peak of {\textgreater}15 bites/person-night at the start of the night (1800-1900 hours) to ≈ 2 bites/person-night before dawn. An. darlingi was the most common species collected indoors, with a biting rate of ≈ 3-4 bites/person-night until about midnight, when the rate dropped below 1 bite/person-night, before showing a secondary peak before dawn. Sixty-four mosquito nets were analyzed by the technique of high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) for levels of deltamethrin (DM). All but two (62) of these were reported by their owners to have been impregnated with insecticide, and 53 were found by HPLC to have deltamethrin. However, one half (32) of the nets had concentrations {\textless}4 mg/m2 and therefore were likely to have been inadequately protective. An inverse association was found between the reported time between washes and deltamethrin concentration. These findings show a need for additional protection from mosquitoes when not inside nets, as well as for more effective impregnation, possibly through wash-resistant insecticide formulation. {\textcopyright} 2009 Entomological Society of America.},

abstract = {Hookworm is a widely prevalent human parasite and an important contributor to anemia worldwide. Efforts to control hookworm in developing countries currently focus on chemotherapy, especially for school-aged children. Due to the high rates of post-treatment hookworm reinfection and other factors that limit the success of school-based chemotherapy programs, a vaccine would represent a major new tool in the control of hookworm. Recent developments in the molecular biology of hookworm have made it possible to develop a recombinant vaccine. As hookworms have fundamentally different epidemiologic and immunologic characteristics to viral and bacterial infections, special methodologic and statistical consideration is needed in clinical trial design and evaluation. There are many remaining obstacles and issues in the research, large-scale development and delivery of a vaccine for a disease that afflicts the poorest of the poor in developing countries. There is also a need to assess the cost-effectiveness of vaccination relative to chemotherapy programs. This review summarizes current progress in vaccine development and discusses some of these issues and ongoing efforts to overcome remaining challenges. {\textcopyright} 2005 Future Drugs Ltd.},
